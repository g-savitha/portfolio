Ever wondered what\u0026rsquo;s the difference between two?\nWhy do we need to pass props ? Do we always need to pass props ?\nConsider the example below.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  import React, { Component } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; class Game extends Component {  constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { player : \u0026#34;Robin\u0026#34;, score : 25 } } render() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Cricket\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Current Player :{this.state.player}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Current Score : {this.state.score}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } } export default Game;   Every time we are writing a component, we are extending it from React component (The base component class) and that\u0026rsquo;s really important if we don\u0026rsquo;t do that we would be missing a ton of react functionality.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s step out of react world for just a moment and let\u0026rsquo;s mimic our own component class\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  class Component { constructor() { console.log(\u0026#34;INSIDE COMPONENT CONSTRUCTOR\u0026#34;) } } class Game extends Component { constructor(){ console.log(\u0026#34;INSIDE GAME CONSTRUCTOR\u0026#34;) } }   Lets make a new game\n1  let cricket = new Game();   So you might think, when we initialized a new game, a constructor is called and that should be printed out, unfortunately we get an error\nsays : Must call super constructor before accessing \u0026lsquo;this\u0026rsquo; . Loosely translated, call a super constructor in derived class before basically doing anything.\nProblem is we are extending the base class but we never actually called its constructor and that\u0026rsquo;s super important to do in the derived class\u0026rsquo;s constructor (Inside Game\u0026rsquo;s constructor here), we need to make sure that we\u0026rsquo;re calling the class (it\u0026rsquo;s constructor) we are extending, especially in React because that\u0026rsquo;s how we call all the magic setup stuff that React does and takes care of out of the box for us. so we call super()\n1 2 3 4 5 6  class Game extends Component { constructor(){ super()  console.log(\u0026#34;INSIDE GAME CONSTRUCTOR\u0026#34;) } }   Now try to instantiate again.\n1 2 3 4  let cricket = new Game(); //output:  //INSIDE COMPONENT CONSTRUCTOR  //INSIDE GAME CONSTRUCTOR   What does super(props) do then? Lets look at this example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  import React, { Component } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; export default class Food extends Component { render() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;HI I AM FOOD COMPONENT\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } }   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  import React, { Component } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39; import Food from \u0026#34;./Food\u0026#34; class App extends Component { render(){ return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Food item = \u0026#34;PineApple\u0026#34; nutrition=\u0026#34;10\u0026#34;/\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt;); } } export default App;   We are passing two props to Food component. You can think of it like we are creating two objects for Food class new Food({item : \u0026quot;pineapple\u0026quot;, nutrition: \u0026quot;10\u0026quot;})\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  import React, { Component } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; export default class Food extends Component { constructor() { super(); console.log(this.props); // undefined.  } render() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;HI I AM FOOD COMPONENT\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } }   We get output as Undefined even though we have props. OK, what\u0026rsquo;s happening here is if we want to access this.props in the constructor, we have to pass props in super (super(props)). This is kind of bizzare, lets consider this example.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  import React, { Component } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; export default class Food extends Component { constructor() { super(); console.log(this.props); // undefined.  console.log(props) // {item:\u0026#34;pineapple\u0026#34;, nutrition:10}  } render() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;  \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{this.props.item}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; /*Prints out pineapple*/ \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } }   However if you do\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  import React, { Component } from \u0026#39;react\u0026#39;; export default class Food extends Component { constructor() { super(props);  console.log(this.props); // {item:\u0026#34;pineapple\u0026#34;, nutrition:10}  } render() { return ( \u0026lt;div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{this.props.item}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; /*Prints out pineapple*/ \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } }   To conclude, If you want to use this.props inside constructor, you need to pass props in super(), otherwise it‚Äôs okay to not pass props to super() as we see that irrespective of passing it to super(), this.props is available inside render() function.\nHopefully that was not convoluted and crazy, until next time.

Also, React will sometimes batch (squash together) calls to setState together into one for performance reasons. If a call to setState() depends on current state, the safest thing is to use the alternate ‚Äúcallback form‚Äù.\nsetState Callback Form this.setState(callback)\nInstead of passing an object, pass it a callback with the current state as a parameter. The callback should return an object representing the new state.\n1  this.setState((curState) =\u0026gt; ({ count: curState.count + 1 }));   Abstracting State Updates The fact that you can pass a function to this.setState lends itself nicely to a more advanced pattern called functional setState.\nBasically you can describe your state updates abstractly as separate functions. But why would you do this?\n1 2 3 4 5 6  // elsewhere in the code function incrementCounter(prevState) { return { count: prevState.count + 1 }; } // somewhere in the component this.setState(incrementCounter);   Because testing your state changes is as simple as testing a plain function:\n1  expect(incrementCounter({ count: 0 })).toEqual({ count: 1 });    This pattern also comes up all the time in Redux!\n Here is a nice opinionated article on the subject of using functional setState\nMutable Data Structures in State Mutable Data Structures We know how to set state to primitives: mainly numbers and strings. But component state also commonly includes objects, arrays, and arrays of objects.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  this.state = { // store an array of todo objects  todos: [ { task: \u0026#34;do the dishes\u0026#34;, done: false, id: 1 }, { task: \u0026#34;vacuum the floor\u0026#34;, done: true, id: 2 }, ], };    You have to be extra careful modifying your array of objects!\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  completeTodo(id) { const theTodo = this.state.todos.find(t =\u0026gt; t.id === id); theTodo.done = true; // NOOOOO -\u0026gt; WRONG WAY  this.setState({ todos: this.state.todos // bad -\u0026gt; VERY BAD WAY TO SET LIKE THIS  }); }   Why? It‚Äôs a long story‚Ä¶\nMutating nested data structures in your state can cause problems w/ React. (A lot of the time it‚Äôll be fine, but that doesn‚Äôt matter. Just don‚Äôt do it!)\nImmutable State Updates A much better way is to make a new copy of the data structure in question. We can use any pure function to do this‚Ä¶\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  completeTodo(id) { // Array.prototype.map returns a new array  const newTodos = this.state.todos.map(todo =\u0026gt; { if (todo.id === id) { // make a copy of the todo object with done -\u0026gt; true  return { ...todo, done: true }; } return todo; // old todos can pass through  }); this.setState({ todos: newTodos // setState to the new array  }); }   Pure functions such as .map, .filter, and .reduce are your friends. So is the ‚Ä¶ spread operator.\nThere is a slight efficiency cost due to the O(N) space/time required to make a copy, but it‚Äôs almost always worth it to ensure that your app doesn‚Äôt have extremely difficult to detect bugs due to mischevious side effects.\nImmutable State Summary  While it sounds like an oxymoron, immutable state just means that there is an old state object and a new state object that are both snapshots in time. The safest way to update state is to make a copy of it, and then call this.setState with the new copy. This pattern is a good habit to get into for React apps and required for using Redux.  Designing State Designing the state of a React application (or any modern web app) is a challenging skill! It takes practice and time! However, there are some easy best-practices that we can talk about in this section to give you a jump-start.\nMinimize Your State In React, you want to try to put as little data in state as possible.\nLitmus test\n does x change? If not, x should not be part of state. It should be a prop. is x already captured by some other value y in state or props? Derive it from there instead.  Bad Example of State Design Let‚Äôs pretend we‚Äôre modelling a Person‚Ä¶\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7  this.state = { firstName: \u0026#34;Matt\u0026#34;, lastName: \u0026#34;Lane\u0026#34;, birthday: \u0026#34;1955-01-08T07:37:59.711Z\u0026#34;, age: 64, mood: \u0026#34;irate\u0026#34;, };    Does Matt‚Äôs first name or last name ever change? Not often I hope‚Ä¶ Does Matt‚Äôs birthday ever change? How is that even possible! Matt‚Äôs age does change, however if we had this.props.birthday we could easily derive it from that. Therefore, the only property here that is truly stateful is arguably mood (although Matt might dispute this üòâ).  Fixed Example of State Design 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  console.log(this.props); { firstName: \u0026#39;Matt\u0026#39;, lastName: \u0026#39;Lane\u0026#39;, birthday: \u0026#39;1955-01-08T07:37:59.711Z\u0026#39;, age: 64 } console.log(this.state); { mood: \u0026#39;insane\u0026#39; }   State Should Live On the Parent Its better to support \u0026ldquo;downward data flow\u0026rdquo; philosophy of React. In general, it makes more sense for a parent component to manage state and have a bunch of ‚Äúdumb‚Äù stateless child display components. This makes debugging easier, because the state is centralized. It‚Äôs easier to predict where to find state:\nIs the current component stateless? Find out what is rendering it. There‚Äôs the state.\nTodo Example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  class TodoList extends Component { constructor(props) { super(props); this.state = { todos: [ { task: \u0026#34;do the dishes\u0026#34;, done: false, id: 1 }, { task: \u0026#34;vacuum the floor\u0026#34;, done: true, id: 2 }, ], }; } /* ... lots of other methods ... */ render() { return ( \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt; {this.state.todos.map((t) =\u0026gt; ( \u0026lt;Todo {...t} /\u0026gt; ))} \u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; ); } }   TodoList is a smart parent with lots of methods, while the individual Todo items are just \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; tags with some text and styling.\n","description":"","id":21,"section":"posts","tags":[],"title":"React State Patterns","uri":"https://www.gsavitha.in/posts/react-state-patterns/"},{"content":"Yes you read it right, you can build and host your website in 10 min üòé.\nBut how?\nStatic site generators to the rescue Ok but first, what is a static site? üòï Basically websites are of two types, static and dynamic. A static site as the name sounds it is - static, constant and fixed. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t change dynamically when a developer makes a change to a file . They just create the static content(HTML and CSS) and upload them on to the server where it remains unchanged.\nWhere as dynamic sites are in almost constant state of change and are powered by servers or Content Management Systems(CMS). Server or CMS builds each page dynamically whenever a change occurs. When a URL is requested to fetch, CMS gets the appropriate data from the DB, loads on HTML, renders the content within template and returns formatted HTML to client\u0026rsquo;s browser. This process is also known as server side processing.\nLooks like CMS website is the solution, then why SSG? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Oh boy, you are a tough cookie. Lets see few of the disadvantages of CMS in brief.\n As CMS started growing popularity, CMS plugins or software have become more vulnerable to cyber attacks and this number is growing. Performance issues. Obviously, because server is doing the more work. Page needs to be loaded each and every time a request is sent, whenever a user visits a site, backend code needs to startup, interact with DB, construct a HTTP response and send it back to server, after all this stuff is done, finally HTML file is returned to display the content.  Ok, how SSGs helps us? Static site generators (SSGs) allow you to have a compromise between writing out a bunch of static html pages and using a potentially heavy (CMS) - retaining the benefits of both üòÆ . Cool right? SSGs give us a flexibility to write code dynamically and publish statically.\nSSGs generates all the static pages of your site at once and deploys it to HTTP server.\nFew of the benefits of using SSGs in brief  Speed and performance. Secured. Now we dont have the problems that come with CMS powered websites. Since static website is solely static files, they have no DB - no DB means no chance of getting hacked . Improved cost and reliabilty. As we dont have a DB, we dont get connection errors like failed to establish connection to DB and also less maintenance costs as we dont have DB any more.  Types of SSGs Now, lets look at some of the most popular options.\n Hugo is a very popular SSG which claims itself as a fastest framework for building sites. It is written in Go Next.js is a server-rendered framework developed on top of React. Gatsby.js is built in React and uses GraphQL to manipulate data. It works great with documentation and blogs. Jekyll is written using Ruby.  Enough with words, Let\u0026rsquo;s get started by building a site. Shall we?\nBuild site with Hugo First things first\u0026hellip;\nInstall hugo To install hugo on linux(Ubuntu and Debian) from your terminal, run\n1 2  sudo apt-get install hugo   For other platforms, check the official guide\nCreate a site Once you install hugo, create a hugo site by running\n1 2  hugo new site mywebsite   Select a theme You need to pick a theme before starting. Wish there was some default theme to get started with. Anyways, there are lots of choices over here. I personally recommend to choose Minimo as it is simple to get started with (You can tweak it later), and also i\u0026rsquo;m a great fan of minimalism üòâ\nInstalling the theme Basically you can install a theme in 3 ways.\n Download the zip file and unzip it manually in themes folder As a git clone As a git submodule.  I recommend that you avoid the git submodule workflow they suggest on the page. You surely want to tweak the theme in future. Its best to have a repo for both the content and the theme same, as the deployment becomes easier (speaking out of personal experience üòÖ , this method gave me a nightmare üòì).\nOk jokes apart. You can download the zip and unzip it manually in the themes/minimo . This method doesn\u0026rsquo;t work greatly all the time.\nSo I recommend to clone the repository. From your terminal run\n1  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo themes/minimo   For installation using other methods and also to tweak the website according to your needs. Check out the official docs\nOnce you have cloned the repo, you need to configure the config.toml . As this is the file, which tells Hugo some details of the configuration to the website you created. So copy the config.toml from the theme whichever you have installed so that you dont accidentally change the theme\u0026rsquo;s info. You can change the info from theme once you are familiar with hugo. If you are a beginner it is not recommended to do so.\n1  cp themes/minimo/exampleSite/config.toml .   That\u0026rsquo;s it your website is created. Tweak the config.toml with your details and start using it. üòÉ\nAdd content and start the server To start the server, run the following command in terminal\n1  hugo serve -D   -D command builds the static pages.\nYou can create a new post by creating a new .md file, prefixing it with your filename. To create some content run\n1  hugo new posts/firstpost.md   This posts folder automatically gets created in content folder. Edit this newly created file with your content\nIt will look something like this.\n1 2 3 4 5  --- title: \u0026#34;First post\u0026#34; date: 2019-03-26T08:47:11+01:00 draft: true ---   Host and publish the site on your custom domain Once you have created your site. You can host it on github-pages or netlify or vercel or gitlab. My personal favourite is github-pages.\nTo know how to host it on gh-pages, refer this official doc. By hosting the site on the respective platform, you will be given a default domain, you can use it or if you wish to have custom domain. Follow the below steps.\nIf you have hosted it on github pages.\n Go to your repository settings, under github pages, choose gh-pages branch as the source of your website. Under custom domain, add your own domain. Thats it your website is now live! üòç  Few resources to learn hugo Giraffe Academy playlist on youtube\nOfficial Hugo Docs\nLearn more about SSGs here\n","description":"","id":22,"section":"posts","tags":["hugo","website","portfolio"],"title":"Build your own website in 10 min! with hugo ","uri":"https://www.gsavitha.in/posts/build-your-own-site/"}]
