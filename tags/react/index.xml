React Component Lifecycle Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that one can override to run code at particular times in the process.
These components comes with methods which allows developers to update application state and reflect the changes to the UI before/after key react “events”.
There are three main phases in a component&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle:</description></item><item><title>React Forms</title><link>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-06-react-forms/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Aug 2020 17:51:50 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-06-react-forms/</guid><description>Note: These notes are taken from Colt steele&amp;rsquo;s Modern React Bootcamp course
Forms HTML form elements work differently than other DOM elements in React Form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name: 1&amp;lt;form&amp;gt; 2 &amp;lt;label for=&amp;#34;fullname&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Full Name:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt; 3 &amp;lt;input name=&amp;#34;fullname&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; 4 &amp;lt;button&amp;gt;Add!&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; 5&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt; Thinking About State 1&amp;lt;form&amp;gt; 2 &amp;lt;label for=&amp;#34;fullname&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Full Name:&amp;lt;/label&amp;gt; 3 &amp;lt;input name=&amp;#34;fullname&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; 4 &amp;lt;button&amp;gt;Add!</description></item><item><title>React Events</title><link>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-05-react-events/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2020 14:55:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-05-react-events/</guid><description>Note: These notes are taken from Colt steele&amp;rsquo;s Modern React Bootcamp course
React Events Review Commonly used React Events You can attach event handlers to HTML elements in React via special reserved attributes. (You can do this in vanilla JS too, though the syntax is a bit different.)
Event Attributes Any event you can listen for in JS, you can listen for in React.
Examples:
Mouse events: onClick, onMouseOver, etc Form events: onSubmit, etc Keyboard events: onKeyDown, onKeyUp, onKeyPress Full list Example: WiseSquare.</description></item><item><title>React State Patterns</title><link>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-04-react-state-patterns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 15:52:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-04-react-state-patterns/</guid><description>Note: These notes are taken from Colt steele&amp;rsquo;s Modern React Bootcamp course
Setting State Using State We know that setState() is asynchronous…
So: it’s risky to assume previous call has finished when you call it. Also, React will sometimes batch (squash together) calls to setState together into one for performance reasons. If a call to setState() depends on current state, the safest thing is to use the alternate “callback form”.</description></item><item><title>Intro to State</title><link>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-03-intro-to-state/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 14:57:47 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-03-intro-to-state/</guid><description>Note: These notes are taken from Colt steele&amp;rsquo;s Modern React Bootcamp course
What is State? Thinking about state In any sufficiently advanced web application, the user interface has to be stateful.
logged-in users see a different screen than logged-out users clicking “edit profile” opens up a modal (pop-up) window sections of a website can expand or collapse, for instance clicking “read more” The state of the client interface (frontend) is not always directly tied to state on the server.</description></item><item><title>CRA and Modules</title><link>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-02-cra-modules/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 13:23:51 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-02-cra-modules/</guid><description>Note: These notes are taken from Colt steele&amp;rsquo;s Modern React Bootcamp course
Create react App React is a front-end library — you don’t need server-side stuff. You can get react.js and react-dom.js from a CDN. You can transpile JSX in the browser at runtime. But there’s a better way!
Create-React-App is a utility script that:
Creates a skeleton react project Sets it up so that JS files are run through Babel automatically.</description></item><item><title>Intro to React</title><link>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-01-intro-to-react/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Aug 2020 12:28:38 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://g-savitha.github.io/notes/ch-01-intro-to-react/</guid><description>Note: These notes are taken from Colt steele&amp;rsquo;s Modern React Bootcamp course
