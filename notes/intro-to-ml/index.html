Its an approach to try and achieve AI through systems that can find patterns in a set of data. According to Stanford, <em>ML is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.</em></li><li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> Deep learning or Deep Neural Networks is just one of the <em>techniques for implementing ML</em>.</li><li><strong>Data Science:</strong> Often the role of Data Science and ML expert are quite overlapping. Field of DS simply means <em>analyzing data, looking at data and then doing something with it</em>, usually some sort of business goal.If you are a Data scientist you need to know ML. If you are an ML expert you need to know DS. You cant do one without the other.</li></ul><p><img src=https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*4Wl_EOjivZu1qmdUBol7WQ.png alt=diffbetweenall4></p><h2 id=types-of-ml>Types of ML</h2><p>ML is simply about predicting results based on incoming data. Some of the machine learning categories we often see&mldr;</p><ul><li><em><strong>Supervised learning</strong></em> : The data that we recieve already has <em><em>categories</em></em>[ <strong>labeled data</strong> and <strong>test data</strong>].<ul><li>ML algorithm tries to use the data to predict a label if it guesses the label wrong, the algo corrects itself and tries again. coz of This active correction its called supervised learning</li><li><em>Classification</em> : The goal is to <em>predict discrete values</em>, e.g. {1,0}, {True, False}, {spam, not spam}.<ul><li>binary classification -> only 2 options</li><li>multi-classification -> more than 2 options</li></ul></li><li><em>Regression</em> : The goal is to <em>predict continuous values</em>, e.g. home prices.</li><li>Eg: Predicting stock prices, Hire engineers based on experience or age or where they live [inputs that are labeled]</li><li>Supervised learning algorithms try to <strong>model relationships and dependencies between the target prediction output and the input features</strong> such that we can predict the output values for new data based on those relationships which it learned from the previous data sets.</li><li><strong>List of Common Algorithms:</strong><ul><li>Nearest Neighbor</li><li>Naive Bayes</li><li>Decision Trees</li><li>Linear Regression</li><li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li><li>Neural Networks</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><em><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong></em> : <em>Data without labels</em>. Think of it as csv files without column names labeled<ul><li><em>Clustering</em> : Based on given data, machine identifies different groups.</li><li><em>Association rule learning</em> : We associate different things to predict what customer might buy in the future.</li><li>Unsupervised learning algorithms are <strong>mainly used in pattern detection and descriptive modeling</strong>. These algorithms try to use techniques on the input data to mine for rules, detect patterns, and summarize and group the data points</li><li>Eg: Recommendation systems.</li><li><strong>List of Common Algorithms:</strong><ul><li>k-means clustering, Association Rules</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><em><strong>Transfer learning</strong></em> TL leverages what one machine learning model has learned in another ML model</li><li><em><strong>Semi-supervised learning:</strong></em> In previous two types one has labeled data and the other has none. Semi-supervised learning falls in between these two.</li><li><em><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong></em>: Teaching machines through trial and error.It allows machines and software agents to automatically determine the ideal behavior within a specific context, in order to maximize its performance.<ul><li>Reinforcement learning algorithm called the <em><em>agent</em></em> <em>continuously learns from the environment in an iterative fashion</em>. In the process, the agent learns from its experiences of the environment until it explores the full range of possible states.</li><li>A program simply learns a game by playing it millions of times until it gets the highest score.</li><li><strong>List of Common Algorithms:</strong><ul><li>Q-Learning</li><li>Temporal Difference (TD)</li><li>Deep Adversarial Networks</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=6-step-machine-learning-framework>6 Step Machine Learning Framework</h2><ul><li><strong>Problem definition</strong>: <em>what problem are we solving?</em>. Is it supervised or unsupervised. Is it classification or regression?</li><li><strong>Data:</strong> <em>what kind of data do we have?</em> Different kinds of data..<ul><li>Structured data (spreadsheets), unstructured data(audio or image)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> <em>what defines success for us?</em> There are no 100% perfect models. Instead we begin by saying for so and so project to be feasible we need atleast 95% accurate model.<ul><li><em>Types of metrics</em>:<ul><li><em>Classification</em> : Accuracy, precision, recall</li><li><em>Regression</em> : Mean absolute error (MAE), Mean Squared Error(MSE), Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE)</li><li><em>Recommendation problems</em> : precision at K</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Features:</strong> <em>What do we already know about data?</em><ul><li>Features refers to what <em>kind of data do we have in structured and unstructured data</em>.</li><li>Eg: to predict whether or not someone has a heart disease we might use their body weight as a feature, since body weight is a number. Its called <em>Numerical feature.</em> If someone&rsquo;s body is over a certain number, they are more likely to have a heart disease. There are other features as well like <em>categorical</em> (A person is of which gender) and <em>derived</em> -> creates new feature using the existing ones.(Did a person visit hospital last year)</li><li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong> : Looking at different features of data and creating new ones/altering existing ones.</li><li><strong>Feature Coverage:</strong> The process of ensuring all samples have similar information is called feature coverage. In an ideal dataset we get complete feature coverage (atleast 10% coverage should be there)</li><li>ML algos goal is to make the patterns out of known data to make predictions</li></ul></li><li><strong>Modelling: (splitting data)</strong> <em>Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?</em>. Figure out right model for right kind of problem<ul><li>3 parts to modelling<ul><li>Choosing a training model</li><li>Tuning a model</li><li>Model Comparision</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Experimentation:</strong> <em>How could we improve/what can we try next?</em></li></ul><p><img src=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*Gf0bWgr2wst9A1XR5gakLg.png alt="6 step ML framework">

This may mean your <em>testing data is leaking into your training data</em> (incorrect data splits) or you&rsquo;ve spent too much time optimizing your model for the test set data. <em><strong>Ensure your training and test datasets are kept separate at all times and avoid optimizing a models performance on the test set</strong></em> (use the training and validation sets for model improvement. testing and model comparision on test dataset).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Data mismatch</strong> happens when the data you&rsquo;re testing on is different from the data you&rsquo;re training(such as having different test features on training data and test data).

Ensure the data you&rsquo;re using during experimentation matches up with the data you&rsquo;re using in production.</li><li>The ideal model shows up in <strong>Goldilocks zone(balanced model)</strong> .
