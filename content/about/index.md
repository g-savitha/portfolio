### Hi There <span>&#128075;&#127995;</span>,

I'm Savitha, a software developer based in India who loves to explore new technologies, [build projects](https://github.com/g-savitha), and share my knowledge with others. While I've worked with many programming languages, I'm particularly enthusiastic about JavaScript and its ecosystem :heart: .

My preferred tech stack includes **Node.js, Typescript, React, Styled Components, Mongo/Postgres, and Jest**. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games and chess. I'm also an avid reader of non-fiction and a music enthusiast. In my free time, I love to capture the world through my camera lens. Additionally, I enjoy reading books on philosophy and Indian mythology.

I'm always up for discussing and exchanging ideas with others who share my interests. If any of the above fascinates you, or if you have any opportunities, open-source ideas, or need any assistance, feel free to reach out to me via [email](mailto:gsavitha@protonmail.com?subject=Hello) or Twitter [@gsavitha\_](https://twitter.com/gsavitha_). If you prefer LinkedIn, you can always send me a connection request with a brief introduction about yourself and your interests or ideas to discuss. You can find me on LinkedIn at [@g-savitha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/g-savitha/). Let's connect and keep the conversation going!
