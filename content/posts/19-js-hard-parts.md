Hello there! :wave:

I'm excited to announce the start of a new series on Javascript that aims to provide a deeper understanding of core concepts. Let's dive right in without delay! :rocket:

This series will cover the following topics:

1.  [Execution Context, Callbacks, and Higher-Order Functions]({{< ref "/posts/20-exec-context.md">}}) : This topic will cover the fundamental concepts of the execution context in JavaScript, how callbacks are used in higher-order functions, and why they are essential in modern web development.

2. [Closures](#) : This topic will delve into the inner workings of closures in JavaScript, how they help with encapsulation and privacy, and how to use them effectively in your code.

3. [Asynchronous Javascript](#) :This topic will introduce the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript, how it works with the event loop, and why it is crucial for building modern web applications.

4. [Promises](#) : This topic will focus on how promises work in JavaScript, their syntax and usage, and how they help to solve the problem of callback hell.

5. [Classes and Prototypes](#) : This topic will explain the concepts of classes and prototypes in JavaScript, how they relate to each other, and how they are used to create reusable code.

6. [Iterators](#):This topic will explore the concept of iterators in JavaScript, how they work, and how they can be used to simplify and streamline code.

7. [Generators](#): This topic will delve into generators in JavaScript, how they differ from regular functions, and how they can be used to create custom iterators.
  
<!-- 8. [Functional Programming in JS](#):  -->

> PS: I will be continually updating this series with additional concepts as I explore and delve deeper.

I hope you find this series informative and enjoyable. Until, next time. Happy learning! :tada: :computer:
