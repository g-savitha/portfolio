### Hey there <span>&#128075;&#127995;</span>,

Savitha here. I am a software developer and a nerd from India. I love to try new things, [build stuff](https://github.com/g-savitha) and share the knowledge I gained from it. Even though I've gotten my hands dirty in various languages I love JS :heart: and its ecosystem.

##### My preferred Tech stack

- Node.js
- Typescript
- React
- Styled Components
- Mongo / Postgres
- Jest

Other than coding, in my free time, I play video games and chess (i'm a noob btw :sweat_smile:)at [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/), read some non fiction and listen to some [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/31rsdkn5tx7bs26fsy7nefvcpsda?si=-mcRCEL6RrGXvBafgYk98g).

I'm always reachable via., [email](mailto:gsavitha@protonmail.com?subject=Hello) or tweet me [@gsavitha\_](https://twitter.com/gsavitha_). If you are on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/g-savitha/) feel free to connect anytime to discuss about opportunities or any Open source ideas or incase you need any help. :smile:
