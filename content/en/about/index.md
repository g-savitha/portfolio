### Hey there <span>&#128075;&#127995;</span>,

Savitha here. I am a software developer from India. I love to try new things, [build  stuff](https://github.com/g-savitha) and share the knowledge I gained from it. Even though I've gotten my hands dirty in various languages and frameworks I love JS :heart: and its ecosystem.


In my free time I practice DSA on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/g-savitha/).  Other than coding, I play video games and listen to [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/31rsdkn5tx7bs26fsy7nefvcpsda?si=-mcRCEL6RrGXvBafgYk98g)
    
By the way, I'm maintaining a [repository](https://github.com/g-savitha/Leetcode) of solutions for all the problems I solved on leetcode. My plan is to make it a one stop place to find solutions to all the problems in various programming languages. Please feel free to fork the repository and contribute to it.

I'm always reachable via., [email](mailto:mailto@gsavitha.in?subject=Hello) or tweet me [@gsavitha_](https://twitter.com/gsavitha_). If you are on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/g-savitha/) feel free to connect anytime to discuss about opportunities or any Open source ideas or incase you need any help. :smile:
